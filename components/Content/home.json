  "faq": [
  {
    "FAQ": "Can I get a same-day dumpster rental?",
    "Answer": "Yes! If you call early, same-day delivery is often available. Availability depends on the dumpster size and your location, but we always do our best to get a bin to you ASAP."
  },
  {
    "FAQ": "What can I NOT put in a dumpster?",
    "Answer": "Items like paint, fuel, chemicals, batteries, propane tanks, and medical waste are prohibited. Most other items—trash, furniture, construction debris, and yard waste—are usually acceptable. Contact us if you’re unsure."
  },
  {
    "FAQ": "Can I mix different debris types in one dumpster?",
    "Answer": "For general cleanouts, yes. However, materials like concrete, dirt, roofing shingles, or yard waste should be separated to avoid overweight fees and comply with landfill regulations."
  },
  {
    "FAQ": "How much weight can a dumpster hold?",
    "Answer": "It depends on the dumpster size. Smaller 10-yard bins can handle heavier materials, while larger 30- and 40-yard containers are designed for bulkier, lighter debris. We’ll review all weight limits with you upfront."
  },
  {
    "FAQ": "What if I don’t have a lot of junk—should I still rent a dumpster?",
    "Answer": "Absolutely. A small 10-yard dumpster is often more affordable and convenient than multiple dump runs. It’s ideal for yard cleanup, garage cleanouts, and moving preparation."
  },
  {
    "FAQ": "What payments do you accept for dumpster rental?",
    "Answer": "We accept major credit and debit cards, digital payment options, and business invoices for approved accounts. Payments are processed securely at booking or pickup."
